# Access to CSB

To get access, send a request with your full name, affiliation, and SSH public key to support (see [here](/support)).

To generate the SSH key pair on your MacOS or Linux computer use the following command:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa

And type a **strong** passphrase which will be used to unlock your private key.  
DO NOT leave it empty!

The public key can then be found here: **~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub**  
  
NOTE: **~/.ssh/id_rsa** is your private key and should NOT be
shared.
