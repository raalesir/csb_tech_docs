=======================

To use BOSS 4.9 you can just load the module with

    module load boss/4.9

BOSS stands for Biochemical and Organic Simulation System.
It's the molecular modeling program coming from Bill Jorgensen's lab.
at Yale.

The following description copied verbatim from wikipedia.org

Biochemical and Organic Simulation  System (BOSS) is a general-purpose
molecular   modeling  program   that   performs  molecular   mechanics
calculations,    Metropolis   Monte   Carlo    statistical   mechanics
simulations, and semiempirical Austin Model 1 (AM1), PM3, and PDDG/PM3
quantum    mechanics   calculations.  The    molecular   mechanics
calculations  cover  energy minimizations,  normal  mode analysis  and
conformational  searching  with the  Optimized  Potentials for  Liquid
Simulations (OPLS)  force fields. BOSS  is developed by  Prof. William
L.  Jorgensen  at Yale  University,  and  distributed commercially  by
Cemcomco, LLC and Schr√∂dinger, Inc.
